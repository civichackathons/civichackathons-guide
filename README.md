# Civic Hackathon's Organizer Guide

Welcome to this guide for organizing your very own civic-centric hackathon! This guide is a community initiative put together by [Civic Hackathons](https://civichackathons.com/) and it contains all of the lessons learned from those who have run successful civic hackathons. It also contains free resources and documents that you can use in your own.

{% hint style="info" %}
 This is a living document and is never completely finished. We aim to constantly improve this document as the civic community learns. So, try running your own and contributing your learnings back to the guide by emailing [info@civichackathons.com](mailto:info@civichackathons.com) or by submitting a pull request on the [GitHub repo for this guide](https://github.com/civichackathons/civichackathons-guide).
